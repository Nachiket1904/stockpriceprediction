# Stock Price Prediction using Streamlit 
This project is about predicting the stock prices using Facebook's Prophet model and building an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. Prophet is a time-series forecasting model that uses additive regression models to predict future values. Streamlit is an open-source framework used for building data science applications.
# Installation

```
2. Enter the stock symbol of the company you wish to predict the stock prices for.
3. Select the number of days to predict the future stock prices for.
